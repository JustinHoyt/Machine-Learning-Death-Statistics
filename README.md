# Unsupervised Machine Clustering on US Death Statistics
Death can give us insight into health, so I used the data collected from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/cdc/mortality) to explore clusters of people in an unsupervised manner to extract meaning from this valuable datasource.

## How do I get setup?
* install [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [git large file storage](https://git-lfs.github.com/)
* Clone the repository and initialize git lfs
``` #! bash
$ git clone https://github.com/JustinHoyt/Machine-Learning-Clustering.git
$ (cd Machine-Learning-Clustering/ && git lfs pull)
```
* install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) if you do not have pandas, sklearn, and numpy installed
    * Anaconda is a meta package that installs python along with many popular machine learning packages
